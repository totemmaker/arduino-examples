# Mini Lab projects

Sample projects for showcasing mini lab and side panels modules.

Each project is contained in a separate folder which can be opened directly with Arduino IDE.
Demos presented here are meant as a starting point and inspiration for your own projects.
Required hardware is listed on each project README.md file, together with wiring schematics.

You can find all hardware used here on Totem webshot at https://totemmaker.net/shop.
